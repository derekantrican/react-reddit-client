# react-reddit-client

A Reddit client written with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

This demo was originally created by the [MontageJS](https://montagejs.org/) team, but its link has
been removed because Montage is defunct at time of writing in May 2023. The demo was recreated in
Polymer to compare a small app in both Polymer and in React.
